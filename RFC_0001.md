# Cross Blockchain Ecosystem Index // Scaling Data Index

We have been inspired by Electric Capital's ecosystem index, and we think that a decentralized open source group could 
help drastically scale the data capture and crowd-source this exercise. We also believe that using an NFT incentive like
GitPOAP will help encourage more people to include their open source contributions.

## Background

This data is being aggregated by major corporations like Messari, Nansen, TheTie, TokenTerminal and many others. Given it 
is effectively a measure of open source contribution and the methods of collection could wildly vary, we want to help 
create a source of truth for the growth in the industry that is made available at no fee to the community creating the value.

We think that adhering to Web3 and Open Standards as demonstrated by Electric Capital is true to the ethos that supports
Web3 and Blockchain contributors.

## Proposal

We want to request that Electric Capital work with this Open Ecosystems Collective to kick off forming an open source
collective to help bring this type of data to the community with rewards provided by GitPOAP.

Steps to accomplish these goals.
1. Setup a meeting with Electric and invite their key contributors to join our collective and invite others.
2. Setup meetings with major foundations like Ethereum, Uniswap, Algorand, Optimism, Avalanche and request others to engage.
3. Find delegates from all of these organizations to help be Lieutenants and leverage Linus Torvald's approach to vetting PRs for validity and correctness
4. Setup a regular recurring method of incorporating this data asynchronously and synchronously

### Architecture

This will be a simple easy to understand project for now leveraging the TOML files proposed by Electric Capital
1. User Experience
   1. We will focus on contributor ease and leverage Pull Requests and Approvals by Lieutenants from each organization
2. Infrastructure and Engineering
   1. For now we have none but in the future we could discuss some scheduled jobs that help re-verify that all links have validity and access. 
   2. We could also automate the creation and assignment of issues where we determine there are lacks of categorization in the links.
   3. All of this will be regularly rewarded for top contributors with GitPOAPs for helping organize this data. 

### Costs

For now this costs nothing but time, and it's a complete experiment. We are looking forward to building and experimenting with the community 
to see how we can scale this type of initiative.
